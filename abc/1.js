    overview: 
`I have worked with many businesses having created professional content for the last 10 years.

Helping others standout amongst the competition is my strong-suit. Not only am I a free-lance developer (specializing in Shopify, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) but I know the process of starting a company, owning a business, and creating a product from nothing.

For me communication is everything. I am very easy to work with as far as pleasing a client who knows exactly what they want, or taking an active role in helping someone without experience create a clear vision.

I look forward to working with you!

‚úîÔ∏è Custom theme development.
‚úîÔ∏è Custom Integrations with external apps.
‚úîÔ∏è Customize a pre-existing template
‚úîÔ∏è App development and integration
‚úîÔ∏è Platform migration to Shopify (from Magento, Wordpress, etc.)
‚úîÔ∏è And much more... let us know what you need.

üìå Thorough development and deployment process that ensures quality. Each issue/task is run through a comprehensive workflow which includes:

1. Discovery and clarification
2. Design / Development process
3. Quality Assurance review
4. Code Review
5. Deployment.

Looking forward to working on your project and bringing it to life!`,
