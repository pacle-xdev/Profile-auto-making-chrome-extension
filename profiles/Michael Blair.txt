Not only am I a free-lance developer (specializing in Shopify, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) but I know the process of starting a company, owning a business, and creating a product from nothing.\n\nFor me communication is everything. I am very easy to work with as far as pleasing a client who knows exactly what they want, or taking an active role in helping someone without experience create a clear vision.\n\nI look forward to working with you!\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Custom theme development.\n‚úîÔ∏è Custom Integrations with external apps.\n‚úîÔ∏è Customize a pre-existing template\n‚úîÔ∏è App development and integration\n‚úîÔ∏è Platform migration to Shopify (from Magento, Wordpress, etc.)\n‚úîÔ∏è And much more... let us know what you need.\n\nüìå Thorough development and deployment process that ensures quality.
